* ERA5_NASST_tendency_EuroHW_downstream_analysis.ipynb

Based on ERA5 reanalysis data, this notebook defines criteria to obtain five composites of events with different North Atlantic SST states and tendencies before investigating the lagged behaviour of the downstream summer European climate with respect to the identified North Atlantic SST events. In addition, several meteorological variables are examined, in order to support the proposed "bridge" from cold North Atlantic SST events with a negative tendency to heat events over the European continent.

* ERA5_NASST_EuroHW_upstream_analysis.ipynb

This notebook includes the analysis of European heat events to study the upstream state of the North Atlantic SST. This additional analysis confirms the time lag of about one week between cold North Atlantic SST events with a negative tendency and the emergence of heat events over Europe.
